square root of $x$ is less than $X$, so we can write the inequality:\n$\\sqrt{x} < X$\nSquaring both sides of the inequality, we get:\n$x < X^2$\nSo, we have the inequalities:\n$x > 9$ and $x < X^2$\nTo find the number of integer values of $x$ that satisfy these inequalities, we can try different values of $X$.\nLet's start with $X = 3$:\nFor $X = 3$, we have the inequalities:\n$x > 9$ and $x < 3^2$\n$x > 9$ and $x < 9$\nThere are no integer values of $x$ that satisfy these inequalities.\nNow, let's try $X = 4$:\nFor $X = 4$, we have the inequalities:\n$x > 9$ and $x < 4^2$\n$x > 9$ and $x < 16$\nThe integer values of $x$ that satisfy these inequalities are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.\nSo, for $X = 4$, there are 6 integer values of $x$ that satisfy the given condition.\nTherefore, the value of $X$ is 4.\nThe answer is: 4", "At the end of the fourth day, the snowdrift was 34 inches deep.\nOn the fourth day, 18 inches of snow fell onto the snowdrift.\nSo, at the end of the third day, before the snowfall, the snowdrift was 34 - 18 = 16 inches deep.\nOn the third day, it snowed again, adding 6 inches onto the snowdrift.\nSo, at the end of the third day, before the snowfall, the snowdrift was 16 - 6 = 10 inches deep.\nOn the second day, half of the snowdrift melted.\nSo, at the end of the second day, before the melting, the snowdrift was 10 x 2 = 20 inches deep.\nTherefore, at the end of the first day, before any snowfall or melting, the snowdrift was 20 inches deep.\n#### 20\nThe answer is: 20", "Pogo leaves 4 footprints every meter, so for 6000 meters, Pogo will leave

teaspoons of cardamom Martha adds to the spice paste.\nLet's break down the information given:\nAmount of ginger: 3 tablespoons\nAmount of cardamom: x teaspoons\nAmount of mustard: 1 teaspoon\nAmount of garlic: 2 tablespoons\nAmount of chile powder: 4 times as much as mustard\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\nAmount of ginger + Amount of cardamom + Amount of mustard + Amount of garlic + Amount of chile powder = Total amount of spice paste\n3 tablespoons + x teaspoons + 1 teaspoon + 2 tablespoons + (4 * 1 teaspoon) = Total amount of spice paste\nLet's simplify and solve for x:\n3 tablespoons + x teaspoons + 1 teaspoon + 2 tablespoons + 4 teaspoons = Total amount of spice paste\n(3 * 3 teaspoons) + x teaspoons + 1 teaspoon + (2 * 3 teaspoons) + 4 teaspoons = Total amount of spice paste\n9 teaspoons + x teaspoons + 1 teaspoon + 6 teaspoons + 4 teaspoons = Total amount of spice paste\n20 teaspoons + x teaspoons = Total amount of spice paste\nTo determine the percentage of the spice paste that is ginger, we need to divide the amount of ginger by the total amount of spice paste and then multiply by 100:\n(9 teaspoons / (20 teaspoons + x teaspoons)) * 100 = Percentage of spice paste that is ginger\nTo find the rounded integer value, we can use the round function:\npercentage = round((9 / (20 + x)) * 100)\nSince we know that the answer is 43, we can set up the equation:\n43 = round((9 / (20 + x)) * 100)\nLet's solve for x:\n43 = round((9 / (20 + x)) * 100)\n43 = round((9 / (20 + x)) * 100)\n43 = round((9 / (20 + x)) * 100)\n43 = round((9 / (20 + x)) * 100)\nTo solve for x, we need to reverse the steps:\n(9 / (20 + x)) * 100 = 43\nTo isolate x, we divide both sides of the equation by 100:\n(9 / (20 + x)) = 43 / 100\nTo solve for x, we flip the equation:\n(20 + x) / 9 = 100 / 43\nTo solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 9:\n20 + x = (100 / 43) * 9\nTo solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:\nx = (100 / 43) * 9 - 20\nTo find the rounded integer value of x, we can use the round function:\nx = round((100 / 43) * 9 - 20)\nx = round(20.930232558139535 - 20)\nx = round(0.930232558139535)\nx = 1\nThe value
